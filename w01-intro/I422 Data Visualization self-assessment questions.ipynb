    "This course requires basic understanding of linear algebra, statistics, and programming. This (ungraded) quiz lets you (and us) assess whether you have a good basis for taking this course. If you are comfortable with the following questions (the questions are supposed to be trivial for I590 students), you will not have too much difficulty. If you find the following questions challenging, you may need to put lots of efforts throughout your course. Of course we will do our best to help you if you are willing to learn."
