# Module 8: Histogram
## Number of bins in a histogram

- Nick Strayer: [Histograms are fantastic, but make sure your bin-width/number is chosen well. This is the _exact_ same data, plotted with different bin-widths. Notice that the pattern doesn't necessarily get clearer as bin num increases.](https://twitter.com/NicholasStrayer/status/1026893778404225024)

## Histogram vs. Boxplot

What are there strengths and weaknesses? 

As a summarization method, a boxplot may be useful if you want to compare multiple (well-behaving) distributions. Boxplots will immediately and precisely show the median, the quartiles, and the rough range of the distribution. 

On the other hand, a boxplot may hide details in the distribution, particularly when the distribution is far from a normal distribution.
