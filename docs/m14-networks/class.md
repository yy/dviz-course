# Module 14: Networks

## What is a network? 

What is a network and why do we want to visualize it? Probably the best example is the _social network_. Imagine your friends and then imagine the connections between them in addition to the connections between you and your friends. That's a network already! Now imagine the network around your friends, and then the network around your friends' friends, and so on. If we count all the connections between everyone in our society, that's our social network. 

Networks are, in fact, _everywhere_.
