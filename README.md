# Course overview

From dashboards to cutting-edge scientific papers, from a home office to the
largest companies in the world, we extensively use data visualization to reveal
patterns in data. As our world becomes increasingly connected and digitized,
and as decisions are increasingly driven by data, data visualization is
becoming a critical skill for every knowledge worker. This course is an
introduction to basic statistical data analysis and visualization. We will
learn fundamentals of data visualization, in the context of visual perception,
integrity, design, and statistics, as well as various types of data and
visualization techniques. The hands-on exercises using Python stack and D3.js
will be an integral part of the course.

Therefore, this course may be suitable for students who pursue their careers in research, developement, data analysis, and so on. 
- **Announcements**: All announcements will be sent via Canvas and Slack. 
- **Prerequisites**: This course is open to advanced undergraduate students (I422/H400) as well as graduate students (I590). Because programming (in Python and Javascript) is an integral part of the course, it is required to have good understanding and working knowledge of programming. The basic programming courses (Both I210/I211 or equivalent) are required prerequisites. In addition, *I308: Information Representation* and a basic statistics course is a recommended prerequisite. Basic understanding of design process and web (HTML, CSS, Javascript) is also highly recommended.
